How do Gift Cards work? What if I know NOTHING about the theme? Each game contains puzzles, codes and problem-solving challenges, which anyone can participate in. Knowledge of the theme will certainly help you go faster, and have some more giggles too, but there will be additional resources hidden throughout your gameplay which will teach you to answer each question. Our GameMasters are super fun to help with hints whenever and can tweak questions to work to your knowledge level better. Escape what? Escape rooms are pretty much a board game you walk through, combined with a scavenger hunt. Based on varying themes, you must solve clues, puzzles and in our case, trivia, in order to finish/escape the game/room. Work as a team to communicate, delegate and solve your way out! Is each theme its own TV show or Movie? Each room to escape combines questions from one property, or several of the same themed property (Same Director, genre, sequels, etc). Your knowledge of your FAV will certainly come in handy, but the other properties can still be solved even if you\u2019ve never seen it before through various strategies that provide the answer (codes, jumbles, hidden hints, etc) . I want to play a finished/expired theme still! Each of our themed rooms are only available for a limited time; between 3 to 6 months max. Once we've retired the theme, we compress and revise the game to a deliverable table-top version that we call \"ESCAPE CRATES\". If you missed a theme after we tear it down, look out for the alternative at-home version shortly afterwards. Youth appropriate? Some escape rooms rely on dark, scary environments, but our themes focus on fun, light and well lit themed rooms. We\u2019re very proud of our \u2018sets\u2019 with a lot of detail going in to each room\u2026we want you to see it all! All ages are welcome as long as they can be responsible. Fully locked in? Safety is a major concern, so each room you venture into has easily identifiable exits. Our game-master also has eyes on you the entire game, assisting and monitoring for the best and safest experience. Who will I play with? When you book your time slot, it\u2019s only with your own people. No strangers, just friends and family with us. We will not be responsible for coordinating teams for you. Only provided time slots? If you would like to schedule a time slot outside our regular hours we can certainly accommodate special requests. Shoot us an email and we can work something out! Refunds or exchanges? Cancellations with more than 72 hours notice are applicable for a full refund. We are reserving your time slot and since it\u2019s limited capacity we rely on you to come through. If you\u2019re not able to make it, you are responsible for finding someone else to exchange the tickets. Cash only? When/how do I pay? Due to the limited amount of slots available, and the high demand of attendance, payment in full is required to confirm reservation.
