Un seul indice pour le moment: une tulipe en pot a été retrouvée sur chaque lieu présumé de l’enlèvement. La population a peur et la police est à cran, l’enquête patauge et personne ne parle. Qui se cache derrière tout ça? Qu’est ce qui relie les disparus? Et surtout où sont-ils?

Vous pouvez former des équipes et même pimenter l’expérience avec une compétition amicale contre la montre. Prêts à relever le défi ? Non, c'est l'un de nos grands avantages ! Après l'achat d'un jeu, vous avez 12 mois pour démarrer votre aventure à tout moment, sans réservation. Jouez le jour qui vous convient, à l'heure de votre choix. Nous recommandons cependant de jouer avant la tombée de la nuit, car certaines énigmes nécessitent de lire des panneaux ou d'observer des détails sur les bâtiments. Un jeu dure généralement entre 1 et 2 heures, selon votre progression. Chaque énigme est chronométrée, avec un délai de 30 minutes pour la plupart des défis, ajoutant une touche d'excitation supplémentaire!",

Chez Adventure City Games, contrairement aux escape rooms traditionnelles enfermées entre quatre murs, nos jeux s’intègrent harmonieusement à l’énergie vibrante de la ville, offrant une expérience immersive en plein air, à tout moment, n’importe où. Nous avons imaginé des jeux que vous pourriez jouer quand vous le souhaitez, en extérieur, en plein cœur de la ville. C’est ainsi que tout a commencé. De la découverte d’une fresque cachée dans le centre-ville de Vancouver à la résolution de mystères dans les ruelles de New-York, nous nous sommes délectés du charme unique de chaque ville.",
